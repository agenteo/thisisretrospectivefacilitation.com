        <title>Retrospectives are boring and useless</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gitte share her insights on how to avoid boring and useless retrospectives. Remembering we operate in a complex adaptive system, themed retrospectives, external facilitators and more. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200px&quot; src=&quot;/assets/gitte_klitgaard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gitte Klitgaard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-bio&quot;&gt;Short bio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gitte Klitgaard is an agile coach with more than a decade of experience working for companies as well as coaching individuals. She lives and loves agile, and hates turf wars, which is why she took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods, when we can use that energy to help people? Gitte wants to change the world by helping people work better together and feel better about themselves. She is known for speaking her mind in a way that helps people actually listen to what she says; maybe because her main working tools are listening and caring. As an active part of the agile community, Gitte often engages in discussion online and offline, and is part of the organiser team of German Agile Coach Camp as well as a facilitator at other events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has great interest in how people function, how we communicate, how the brain works, what motivates us, how we can feel better about ourselves, and how to be perfect in our imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in different companies in Europe and developing training as needed, her expertise now centre on soft skills, as she has found this to be something missing in many organisations. The past few years she has been focusing on creating psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2013 Gitte has been speaking and doing workshops, and keynoting at international conferences across three continents (mainly for developers, agile professionals and testers). Her talks are often about the topics we don’t talk about: stress, mental health, inclusion, vulnerability and courage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflection before world retrospective day 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/774124156&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short five minutes reflection I will tell you a little bit about the upcoming world retrospective day 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So world retrospective day is an event to spread the word about the benefits of retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a worldwide event. And it’s self organized event. If you head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldretrospectiveday.com&quot;&gt;http://worldretrospectiveday.com&lt;/a&gt; you will find on the homepage, a link to the list of events for 2020. And in that list, you can find events that are located in in a city or online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one that I’m promoting is actually going to be online on the Pacific West Coast UTC minus eight. And you can find out more about that if you had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wrd2020.thisisretrospectivefacilitation.com&quot;&gt;http://wrd2020.thisisretrospectivefacilitation.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the events are meant to, again, promote retrospectives. And you can find more details on the on the homepage of wordretrospectiveday.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you a little bit about the the events that I participated at during the last year. They are again, self organized, they can be a mix of people with different experiences. So if you feel like you’re you’re a newbie, and you don’t know much about retrospectives, they shouldn’t stop you from creating an event. By hosting an event, you might attract someone that is more experienced to share some of some of their stories with you. You can also do an online event like I’m doing. I live in Los Angeles and usually the commutes here are pretty bad. So I decided to now switch to an online event last year was a physical event. It didn’t go super well. I probably didn’t promote it very well either :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So feel free to set up events if you don’t see one close to you. There’s also the whole coronavirus matter hitting us right now in the US around the world. So being conscious about avoiding avoiding group meetings is another reason to switch to online. So maybe you’re not familiar with online. So this would be like a good experience to set the event. Now, what would you do in a world retrospective Day event? I can tell you again, the the event that I organized is divided in an hour and a half of interactive activities and half an hour with a little bit of information sharing. So the first half an hour there’s going to be a what is a retrospective, what’s the purpose of it, kind of like the basics if you will, and then for an hour and a half, we’re gonna run depending on how many people show up. My current design for this for this session is to have a kind of like a lean coffee style, where we have people sharing anecdotes, or little stories that they want to get feedback or have questions about in terms of retrospectives. The group will run a poll, decide what is the most interesting, interesting topic or interesting topics. And then we’re gonna open up for an open conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, really, depending on the size of the group, we might do breakouts, if there is more than a handful of participants. So this might be a fun way for you to kind of like expose your
expose yourself and attract again, people that maybe have more experience or maybe feel that less experience so you can share your stories with with them and give back something to the to the community. All those events are obviously free and volunteer basis, as far as I know, at least the ones that I’ve seen and again, the spirit is to share good retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So again, if you’re interested, head off to &lt;a href=&quot;http:://worldretrospectiveday.com&quot;&gt;http:://worldretrospectiveday.com&lt;/a&gt; and find an event near you. And if there isn’t one, just create one and contribute back to this community, to the growth and understanding of what retrospectives are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, thank you for listening to this episode. So this is like a new season. I’m gonna start publishing a bit more episodes coming up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An agile retrospective with the Beatles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No Paul didn’t do a retrospective with the Beatles, but the title seems to fit given the example he gave about a technique called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crrglobal.com/orsc.html&quot;&gt;ORSC™&lt;/a&gt; (organization and relationship systems coaching). How you coach the Beatles is different then coaching John, Paul, Ringo and George individually. Paul shares stories about ORSC™ and his facilitation journey.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflection on picking a retrospective framework instead of activities</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/690322372%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-KKSQa&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short reflection wanted to share my thoughts on picking a retrospective framework instead of activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often, you hear people picking a sailboat retrospective or a tree columns retrospective. And those are simply activities, activities to gather data or generate insights. A retrospective framework is something like the five steps framework by Derby/Larsen, or ORID (objective, reflective, interpretive and decision).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the good thing of picking a framework rather than activities is that you will have a structure for your retrospective meeting. And then you can tailor the activities based on the group situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to use the five step framework, which is the one I’m most familiar with, which has again, five steps. The first one is to set the stage. The second one is to gather data. The third one is to generate insights followed by deciding what to do and closing the retrospective. Now, those five steps are rooted I. They seem, I guess, the first time I heard of them kind of overwhelming. But the opening and closing is something that really should happen in any meeting. Opening sets the purpose. So opening set the stage sets the purpose, checks that the temperature and make sure that everyone is on the same page about the objective about what’s going to happen. So let’s jump the last one which is close, which is basically a stat to make sure is everyone everyone is on the same page about what’s going to happen after the retrospective, there was a critical steps, especially the clothes is is a time that you can gather a quick feedback on the retrospective itself. And again, it’s really critical, in my opinion, to save up 510 minutes, depending on the group size at the end. So opening and closing the two steps. And then in the middle, we have something that resemble the what, what So what now what approach where we look at the data. So data data is step number two in the five steps framework to make sure that everyone is on the same page about what happened, what happened in the last year ratio, what happened about the incident or topic that we’re looking at. So gather data, and then generate insights, which is a critical piece of all this. And jury insights, you could see it as a brainstorming. It’s a step where we kind of go into like, divergent thinking. And we try and come up with different ideas, we try and come up with different options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, if you if you imagine that you’re trying to, I often use this example, when I’m around workshop about this five steps is imagine that you’re trying to organize a vacation trip with your friends. And so that will be the purpose. So when you set the stage, we’re going to try and organize this trip together. gathering data will be looking back at your last trip. Maybe as individuals look at the data, think about the good and the bad. The things they would do differently. And the way you phrase this is really like dependent on the group. And generate insights is the piece where once everyone is on the same page about the past experience, they come up with new ideas about how would you like this next trip that we’re organizing to be different. So generate insights, this step where we come up with with different ideas with options about this, and this is a good time to also take a break, let your subconscious kick in and give you even even more, more ideas. And then decide what to do a time to kind of like put this, put this, this retrospective this meeting into into action, make something concrete out of it. So try and use SMART objectives specific, measurable, relevant, achievable, time bound, or whatever acronym that kind of makes the action. The decision actionable. And if you don’t have time, now’s a good moment to reflect on Hey, what’s the next step? If we don’t have an action plan, at least a step was the next step to move forward on this initiative. And then like I said, close out the last five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Retrospectives for organizational change</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jutta wrote a book about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Retrospectives-Organizational-Change-Agile-Approach/dp/1499190255&quot;&gt;retrospectives for organizational change&lt;/a&gt;. In this episode I ask her what drove her to write the book and what challenges she faced facilitating retrospectives for organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflection on roles in retrospectives</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/669743213%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-Rl2uh&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another short reflection episode. And today we’re going to talk about roles during retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a facilitator, you probably might have found yourself in a situation where you’re trying to facilitate a conversation while you’re keeping track of the time for this session or activity. And you’re also like taking notes about what’s being said on a whiteboard. And that can be stressful, and especially when, when you have larger groups. Now, some of those roles can be assigned or can be a way to make the retrospective more engaging for your team. For example, timekeeping,”Who would like me a volunteer today to keep track of time for this activities?” Of course, as a retrospective facilitator, you should prepare your activities before your retrospective. And so you will simply hand over to the timekeeper, the list of activities and how long does activity should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, other activities like taking notes also can be uploaded to volunteers in the group. And that’s even for tracking action items. And if you agree to use SMART action item–or any other way to make them more specific and measurable–maybe that person can remind the group “Hey, this action item is it like specific? And measurable? By when is it going to be done? Who is going to do it?”. So again, as a facilitator, you’re not alone. There is a group of people that you are facilitating for that can help with some of those activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, before the retrospective as a facilitator, you’re probably the individual that will go through and prepare a retrospective plan. But that can be perhaps Don pairing with someone else on the group. Perhaps someone that is interested in the facilitation role and eventually airing during the retrospective itself and ultimately have this person rotate as a facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the retrospective, there’s usually action items. And again, hopefully someone part of the group took note of those. And there are specific, measurable, relevant time bound. And maybe we have someone else that during the week will make sure that those action items are follow true to keep track of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I hope this short reflection will help you in the next retrospective. As a facilitator remember you’re not alone. Maybe you’re a tech lead or a scrum master or a product manager but that doesn’t mean that you need to run the whole show. There is a team of individuals that are probably willing and excited to join you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Discovering retrospectives from the International Association of Facilitators point of view</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of the International Association of Facilitators (IAF)? In this episode we interview Karen and Wiebke–two members of IAF–that run a workshop called “Discovering retrospectives” during the European Conference of the International Association of Facilitators in Milan. I’ve asked about the IAF mission and what insights experienced facilitators had about retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/653734718&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
