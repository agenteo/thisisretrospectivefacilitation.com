        <title>Retrospective Facilitators Gathering (RFG) 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode I have 4 guests: Veit Richter, Malte Sussdorff, Aino Corry, George Dinwiddie. I was with them and about 20 other folks in Massachusetts for a 5 days open space conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/640986156%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-PuLaw&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;regular&quot; src=&quot;/assets/rfg-2019-group-photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;group photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retrospective facilitators gathering is a yearly open space conference–started in 2002–where we discuss retrospective facilitation techniques and everything that connects to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;regular&quot; src=&quot;/assets/rfg-2019-history.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Started in 2002 from a Norm Kerth idea&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you spend one week on a conference dedicated to retrospective facilitation? I attended this year’s (2019) and in this episode I chat with 4 others attendees and we will tell you what we got out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy–another participant of RFG 2019 who’s not on the show–wrote a detailed blog post of his experience https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-personal-retrospective-facilitator-gathering-2019-andreas-schliep/.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing and facilitating a large retrospective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anita, Lukas and Pam  collaborated in facilitating a retrospective for multiple teams with a total of 60 participants. They split the group in smaller groups and used nested diamonds of participatory decision making (from Kaner’s book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wrote a detailed blog post https://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2018/09/05/how-we-facilitated-all-hands-retrospective-60-people-three-hours/ but I wanted to ask a few more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you embark on such an endeavor, what did they learn and what recommendations they have for facilitators about to handle a group this large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/637244664%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-VJkPA&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        <title>War time US Navy debriefings and retrospectives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third of a series of special episodes where I interview former military war veterans–now working in tech related industries–to reflect on their war time after action review experiences and similarities with agile retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode I chat with Dan Greene a former F18 Navy pilot. He tells us about debriefings and a culture of feedback that starts in training. I ask him how the debriefing concept translated to his career outside the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/621331068%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-7Jt9p&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        <title>War time US Army after action review and retrospectives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second of a series of special episodes where I interview former military war veterans–now working in tech related industries–to reflect on their war time after action review experiences and similarities with agile retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode Jon Schneider a fellow Pivot working on the Java Spring team tells us about action items generated during after action review (AAR) in a war zone. He tells us how tactical cycles constantly changes and how the teams collaborated and used ingenuity to adapt and circumvent situations–only apparently–outside their control.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>War time debriefings in the US Marine Corps and retrospectives</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first of a series of special episodes where I interview former military war veterans–now working in tech related industries–to reflect on their war time debriefing experiences and similarities with agile retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some teams often skip retrospectives. What happens when you skip a debriefing in a war-zone? In this episode I speak with Jon Hawkins a USMC war veteran–now Chief Marketing Officer at customer.io–and reflect about similarities between retrospectives and military debriefings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon and I worked together in NYC and I have a lot of fond memories about the time we spent there so I asked him to reflect about retrospectives similarities with war time debriefings. Specifically about placing blame and psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The end goal of a retrospective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s the end goal of a retrospective? I am gonna give you a little spoiler the answer is not to put stuff in three columns and fix all the sad items. In this episode we’ll George Dinwiddie’s answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/607633776%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-vrgje&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;here-are-a-few-highlights-from-george&quot;&gt;Here are a few highlights from George:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get lots of different prospective on things, technical and human side are extraordinarily important for software success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use retrospective facilitation for the first time after coaching TDD for a while to get feedback and reflect on it. I facilitated a 6 people retrospective in our cubicle, someone brought to my attention that I hurt their feelings, was unsure on how to handle that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I felt like I needed to contribute content even tough I was facilitating&lt;/strong&gt;. Esther Derby has been a great mentor of mine. She was the first one that first invited me in 2009 to the Retrospective Facilitation Gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depending on the retrospective we might have different end goals&lt;/strong&gt;. We start by setting up the theme. Which direction are we going? Maybe we’re trying to fix a particular symptom the team in seeing. Maybe in how to deal something long term, sometime on some external issue, what’s the next thing we want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way I define retrospective these days is “looking at the shared past together in order to make choices for the future”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups notice things and that helps others to notice. The things that come out are not the thinks they had on top of their head when they went in. The 3 questions are meant to get starter not the end point. A lot of scrum is simplified because it’s easy to teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people say we already know what’s wrong and how to fix it so we don’t need a retrospective.&lt;/strong&gt; But they arrived to that conclusion alone and not with the team. And other people may disagree or not interpret the symptoms the same way, they may think the cause of the symptoms is different. And you don’t learn this unless you dig in from multiple prospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lot of people like to use the 5 whys to go to the root cause of something. In my experience nothing has a single root cause.&lt;/strong&gt; Any behavior that persistent has a feedback loop that maintains that. People move from 5 why to a fishbone diagram that allows for multiple root causes but if you dig deeper what’s contributing to each of them? If you look you’ll find &lt;strong&gt;reinforcing or inhibiting loops&lt;/strong&gt; within the team, the organization or elsewhere. Once you can visualize it maybe you can remedy. Counteract or balance it somewhere else. &lt;strong&gt;Causal Loop Diagrams come from system thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a lot of books about it out there &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254&quot;&gt;The 5th discipline&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Senge and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/714348.Quality_Software_Management&quot;&gt;Quality Software Management: Systems Thinking&lt;/a&gt; by Gerald Weinberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the first facilitation skills I often see is allowing people to voice their thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’re rotating facilitator maybe you can learn from each other. You don’t need a professional retrospective facilitator. I haven’t studied facilitation. I learn from some great facilitators.  You don’t need huge confidence facilitation skills to facilitate a retrospective. If group is trying to work together they will help facilitate and step in if you overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe people say we don’t need a retrospective. We see a problem we see a solution. That’s true, don’t wait for the retrospective just do it. &lt;strong&gt;During the retrospective I say we need to look at it more deeply at what actually happened&lt;/strong&gt;. Looking together is the best tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing the goal of a retrospective is not always so narrow it preclude someone else’s topic&lt;/strong&gt;. But if it’s really important to someone that it should be included in the goal of the retrospective. In a team if an individual has a problem the whole team has a problem. The structure of a retrospective is not so rigid, if you’re on generating insights but realize you missed something we can go back to gathering data for some specific issue before you moving again to generating insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrospective for groups larger then 15 people is where your facilitation skill get more critical&lt;/strong&gt;. You might struggle to have everyone on the same page. But you can get them more on that. One of the issues I see unwillingness to stick out from the crowd. Exercises when you write first and talk later are helpful. Ensuring it’s a safe environment is also especially critical in large groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The retrospective facilitators gathering is a small open space conference&lt;/strong&gt;. Runs for a week. Pretty open in topic. People get more deep in to the topic. Everyone there is a facilitator. I personally got a lot out of it. You get a lot of different viewpoints. A great change to disconnect from the world and seeing what challenges people are facing and learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s by invitation first to the people that attended the previous year and then goes to the people recommended. People can contact me if they’re interested in early May this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;favorite-retrospective-activity&quot;&gt;Favorite retrospective activity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pick activities that would help a particular group in a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have no background on the team I used to use the timeline. But now my go-to is FRIM (FRequency IMpact) by Diana Larsen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remote retrospectives challenges and advantages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode we talk with David Horowitz creator of &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrium.com&quot;&gt;Retrium&lt;/a&gt; about the challenges–and advantages–of remote retrospectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/566473794%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-G6dOR&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you find it hard to run remote retrospectives? Have you perhaps given up because the team is so disengaged? In this episode we will help with that interviewing David Horowitz creator of &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrium.com&quot;&gt;Retrium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;here-are-a-few-highlights-from-david&quot;&gt;Here are a few highlights from David:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to define agile in two words I’d use: continuous improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile rests on two pillars: product improvement and process improvement. Everyone understand product improvement, but we often forget how we work together–process improvement–is equally important. A team that has  been together for 1 week or 1 month should be less efficient or productive then a team together for much longer. This assumption rest on the assumption that we learn together. The demo is the meeting that catalyzes product improvement and feedback to me the retrospective is the meeting that catalyzes the process improvement part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The goal of a retrospective is learning&lt;/strong&gt;. Focus on–hopefully–one area and learn collectively–instead of on your own–so the team can go forward in the next iteration and improve. Without a retrospective we can learn on our own–or watercooler conversation between two individuals–but if we’re trying to learn as a team we need to be together in the same room… physically or virtually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask an agile purist he’d probably say there is no such thing as a remote team in agile. But we live in a geographically displaced world. Most software is built in a distributed fashion. People across continents or perhaps in the same building across different floors. You probably send instant messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my mind if you have just one person on your team that is remote then you have a remote team.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose you have a 10 person team, 9 sitting in a meeting room and one calling in. Imagine you’re that person calling in. Do you have an equal play field? Or to voice your ideas? Understand the conversation? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once one person is remote we need to act as a remote team.&lt;/strong&gt; In regards to retrospectives, you have lots of colocated facilitation techniques but if you have one person remote I don’t think you can use the same techniques. Unless everyone can participate in the meeting it’s an unfair situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a single person is remote a buddy–in the room–can be assigned&lt;/strong&gt;. The buddy’s job is not just to participate themself but to bubble up the other person’s ideas/feelings/input and make sure they keep involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to encouraging more equal engagement when you have a remote team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I suggest is if there is one remote make everybody remote&lt;/strong&gt;. So if one is dialing in to the meeting make everyone dial in. This might work or not but experimenting with it is a way to encourage engagement and empathy for the people that will always have to dial in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is baseline and baseline per team basis. If video is an option and people are willing to go on video that’s obviously better then voice. If people don’t have video and have voice that’s obviously better then text for most teams. But that’s something that you can discover culturally as you learn together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always some individuals that just prefer just audio. To me this is foreign, but there are some legitimate reason for it. Some are embarrassed about their home tidiness, others have poor bandwidth/rural so can’t have video on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a communication mechanism but what that is should be up to the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for a large bank and we had people spread around the US and Asia and Europe. That’s where I realized how challenging remote retrospectives are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offshore team did not have bandwidth for video so it was just audio. It was a round-robin activity to brainstorm ideas. It was naive of me to expect this activity to keep them engaged. There was complete silence from the phone. Finally I said here are 10 ideas, let’s see the complexity. And it was fascinated what happened. People in the room reflected and voted the complexity. The remote people went silent and after 5 minutes “we estimate it to be a five”. This was a poor facilitation on my side and that event made it click that there was work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a web form to submit ideas is a good first step. If you follow the 5 steps format you need a bit more structure so I decided to quit my job and build &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrium.com&quot;&gt;Retrium.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the team is remote you need to be more intentional about un-intentional conversations&lt;/strong&gt;. When colocated you end up having water-cooler conversations or other type of face to face conversations. When you work remotely you need to have at least a joking instant message channel–like a virtual water-cooler area. That’s not enough in my opinion. You need more then asynchronous conversation. What I suggest is to ping people when you go grab a coffee and keep a zoom chat open while you both grab coffee. And very intentionally you do not talk about work. The same applies to retrospectives too.Whatever you’d do to prep for your co-located retrospective you can do remote, you just have to be more intentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote facilitation is something I would not recommend to people new to facilitation&lt;/strong&gt;. People don’t realize facilitation is a skill that you need to learn and hone. Skills take time to learn. If you’re new to facilitation, start with a job that allows you to learn in a co-located environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you facilitate remotely you have a few extra challenges: a big one is engagement&lt;/strong&gt;. I recommend to hand off your facilitation duties to one of the remote people. If you’re trying to learn collectively the person that is going to limit how much the team is gonna learn is likely to be the remote person. Try to give that person the role of the facilitator to keep them more engaged and to slow down to a pace that keeps everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone can volunteer to be the facilitator it should not be an assigned role.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t find anyone in your team look outside, perhaps create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.retrium.com/circle-of-facilitators&quot;&gt;circle of retrospective facilitators&lt;/a&gt; in your company. Your toolbox is limited, but if you bring in someone from the outside they can bring a new prospective and new tools. Another advantage is they can bring in a new vantage point on the organization and they might bring more ideas about what worked for other teams in the organization. &lt;strong&gt;One downside is if the team doesn’t feel safe to speak up it’s very unlikely you’ll arrive to learning. If you bring in an external facilitator you’re pushing the limit on psychological safety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team should volunteer to have external facilitator or you risk people won’t speak up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody talk about how hard it is to be remote–and it’s true–but there are some things that are easier. It’s harder to be fully anonymous in person then online. Prioritizing with dot voting online can be non-leading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people call retrospectives boring cause nothing is changing after them! It’s a natural reaction&lt;/strong&gt;. The root cause of most retros is it’s not improving your life. It’s important to focus on one area/experiment at the end of retrospective but if no-one has volunteer to be the task ambassador–to drive that change, to followup on that–the idea of collective responsibility gets superseded by day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have many possible actions on the table how do you know which one to pick? Try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.futureworksconsulting.com/blog/2008/05/16/impact-and-energy/&quot;&gt;Idea/Effort/Impact/Energy/Commitment = IEIEC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dot vote on ideas to visualize what’s gonna have impact, take less effort and have energy behind it. When you use this approach usually someone will commit to be the &lt;strong&gt;task ambassador&lt;/strong&gt; to drive the change trough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to understand how to engage with introverts is that they want to share their ideas in a way they’re more comfortable sharing it. As an introvert I used to hate group conversation. But I had ideas. If in meetings I was presented with stick-notes and give time to think and process before being but on the spot I would have been very happy to share my ideas. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re trying to encourage more introverted people to participate in a remote retrospective give them a communication paradigm they’re comfortable on.&lt;/strong&gt; If you put them on the step and ask them “do you have an idea?” you’ll probably get silence.  Usually a more asynchronous communication paradigm–so they have more time to think–and also more written will give you wider adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a set of facilitation techniques on &lt;a href=&quot;http://retrium.com&quot;&gt;Retrium&lt;/a&gt; that would have made my past remote retrospectives easier. We have activities to keep the retrospective format diverse and engaging: lean coffee, start/stop/continue, team radar. We think of it as an educational tool. Guided by the best practices in our industry. The platform will guide you trough the activities and you’ll learn as you go trough the process. &lt;strong&gt;Inexperienced retrospective facilitators have a lot to gain by adopting Retrium because it’s a learning resource in addition of a real time collaboration tool.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most team run retros and they can solve issues at team level but at some point they’ll identify an issue outside of our control. Most teams will just move on. But the issue will come up again. If it’s really preventing your productivity that’s a problem. One thing we’d like to do in Retrium–if you identify 5 action changes–you can mark 2 or 3 to share with the larger organization. That’s transparent information sharing but it’s hard to operationalize without software. If you’re a company at scale that data will get lost at some point. We want to make Retrium not just for teams but for organizational change.&lt;/p&gt;
