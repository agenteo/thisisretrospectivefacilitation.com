## What is retro on retros?

It's a free __remote session__ for folks--regardless of title and experience--that participated in retrospectives or want to learn about it.

It's a time to stop and reflect on how we tune and adjust in our retrospectives.

## What does it look like?

We use different tools and structures based on group size. It's all very interactive. Here's some screenshots or retro on retros run for a client.

We follow an OARRs to communicate clear outcomes, roles, rules and agenda.

After introductions folks share topics sometime as anecdotes to provide context. The group clusters and prioritize topics to discuss.

The group take notes--I tend to do it visually--to capture insights of the discussion.

And we finish it with some feedback on the session.
