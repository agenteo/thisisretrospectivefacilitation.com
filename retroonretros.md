## What is retro on retros?

It's a free __remote session__ for anyone -- regardless of title and experience -- that participated in retrospectives or want to learn about it.

It's a time to stop and reflect on how we tune and adjust our retrospectives.

{% include retroonretros_subscribe.html %}  

## What does it look like?

We use different tools and structures based on group size. It's all very interactive. Here's some screenshots or retro on retros run for a client.

We follow an OARRs to communicate clear Outcomes, Agenda, Roles and Rules.

After introductions, folks share topics to provide context -- sometime as anecdotes. The group clusters and prioritize topics to discuss.

The group takes notes--I tend to do it visually--to capture insights of the discussion.

And we finish it with some feedback on the session.
