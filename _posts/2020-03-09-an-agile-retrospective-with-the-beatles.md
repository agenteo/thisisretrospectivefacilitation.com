No Paul didn't do a retrospective with the Beatles, but the title seems to fit given the example he gave about a technique called [ORSC™](https://www.crrglobal.com/orsc.html) (organization and relationship systems coaching). How you coach the Beatles is different then coaching John, Paul, Ringo and George individually. Paul shares stories about ORSC™ and his facilitation journey.
