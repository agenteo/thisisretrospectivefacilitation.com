This is the third of a series of special episodes where I interview former military war veterans--now working in tech related industries--to reflect on their war time after action review experiences and similarities with agile retrospectives.

In this episode I chat with Dan Greene a former F18 Navy pilot. He tells us about debriefings and a culture of feedback that starts in training. I ask him how the debriefing concept translated to his career outside the military.
