Anita, Lukas and Pam they collaborated in facilitating a retrospective for multiple teams with a total of 60 participants. They split the group in smaller groups and used nested diamonds of participatory decision making (from Kaner’s book).

They wrote a detailed blog post https://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2018/09/05/how-we-facilitated-all-hands-retrospective-60-people-three-hours/ but I wanted to ask a few more questions.

Why would you embark on such an endeavor, what did they learn and what recommendations they have for facilitators about to handle a group this large.
