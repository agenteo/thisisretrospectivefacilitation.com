This is a short five minutes reflection episode. The topic is personal retrospectives.

I've been introduced to it for the first time in reference to Ainsley Nies. I think the concept is somewhat similar to the team retrospectives or group retrospectives that most people are familiar with. But they're focused on yourself.

And especially in those days where we spend more time alone at home. I've found it's a good exercise to pause and reflect.

So personal retrospectives, I think should follow the same approach of a regular retrospective. 

Somewhat the five steps and again when we set the stage for our personal retrospectives is because we should think back what what are we trying to achieve? I think just the fact, for me, just the fact of reflecting on what I've done, what I've achieved is a thing that adds purpose.

 So sometime I focus too much maybe on the negatives. And so just giving myself time to look back at and just pause, just for like 10/15 minutes. And it doesn't have to take more time than that. Another thing that that I like to do is to write down outcomes.So when I set the stage, I kind of prepare pieces of paper to put down possible action items. And then I look at the data. I use a system called GTD short for getting things done. I highly encourage you to look at it as a it's just a way to track things that you're doing by linking them to I think he calls them horizon different level objectives so that you don't just do busy work, but you do things that are connected to some projects, and some something that gives meaning to you. But bottom line, I use GTD to find the items that I completed during the week. So for you, maybe you want to like spend a few minutes thinking back what happened during the week. And then maybe you can group some of those things and signify them. What made you happy? What made you sad? I think the tree comes approaches works pretty well for a personal retrospective, or whatever comes whatever hashtags perhaps you want to, to assign to some of those topics and of those patterns. And then do you see anything then spend a few minutes maybe like just thinking what if What if last week was perfect? What would be one thing that was different? Is there anything actionable out of that, that that you can do? You can use the SMART goal approach, like, Is there something specific, something relevant to you that you can do something achievable in the time and especially in the constraints that we have constraints that we can see, perhaps as enabling constraints to stretch our our boundaries of what we know and how we do things regularly. So out of that, you might come up with action items, things that you might do differently this week.
 
 Again, to me the biggest value I find in personal retrospectives is to the time to pause and look back at the things that I've done during the week. And the things that are coming up next week. To see things in perspective, it kind of fills me up with a sense of achievement and reflection that allows me to maybe adjust the way I've done things this week in the in the week that is coming up.
 
 So I hope that you'll try out to do a personal retrospective. Try to maybe only spend like 10 minutes and write down the things that happened to you this week. And maybe then start assigning tags or find patterns and then maybe see if there is any adjustment that is is easy to do in the coming week. Let us know how your personal retrospective goes!
