In this episode we interview Karen and Wiebke--two members of IAF--that run a workshop called "Discovering retrospectives" during the European Conference of the International Association of Facilitators in Milan. I've asked about the IAF mission and what insights experienced facilitators had about retrospectives. Enjoy the show!
