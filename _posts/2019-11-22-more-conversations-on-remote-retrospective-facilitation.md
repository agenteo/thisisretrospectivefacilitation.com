Together, Kirsten and Jay have specialised in enabling distributed teams to reach high performance, using a combination of adapted facilitation techniques, team coaching methods and Agile frameworks. In the last 3 years they have spoken at conferences on the topic of remote facilitation and creating effective distributed spaces, consulted to a variety of companies and provided remote facilitation training. They also host a monthly learning group to provide a space for facilitators to practice and share remote skills and techniques. Their book on remote facilitation will be published in June 2020 by US publisher Berrett-Koehler Publishers.
