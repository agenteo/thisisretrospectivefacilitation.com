This is the first of a series of special episodes where I interview former military war veterans--now working in tech related industries--to reflect on their war time debriefing experiences and similarities with agile retrospectives.

**Some teams often skip retrospectives. What happens when you skip a debriefing in a war-zone? In this episode I speak with Jon Hawkins a USMC war veteran--now Chief Marketing Officer at customer.io--and reflect about similarities between retrospectives and military debriefings.**

Jon and I worked together in NYC and I have a lot of fond memories about the time we spent there so I asked him to reflect about retrospectives similarities with war time debriefings. Specifically about placing blame and psychological safety.
