### About the guest

#### Short bio

Gitte Klitgaard is an agile coach with more than a decade of experience working for companies as well as coaching individuals. She lives and loves agile, and hates turf wars, which is why she took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods, when we can use that energy to help people? Gitte wants to change the world by helping people work better together and feel better about themselves. She is known for speaking her mind in a way that helps people actually listen to what she says; maybe because her main working tools are listening and caring. As an active part of the agile community, Gitte often engages in discussion online and offline, and is part of the organiser team of German Agile Coach Camp as well as a facilitator at other events.

She has great interest in how people function, how we communicate, how the brain works, what motivates us, how we can feel better about ourselves, and how to be perfect in our imperfections.

Working in different companies in Europe and developing training as needed, her expertise now centre on soft skills, as she has found this to be something missing in many organisations. The past few years she has been focusing on creating psychological safety.

Since 2013 Gitte has been speaking and doing workshops, and keynoting at international conferences across three continents (mainly for developers, agile professionals and testers). Her talks are often about the topics we don't talk about: stress, mental health, inclusion, vulnerability and courage.
