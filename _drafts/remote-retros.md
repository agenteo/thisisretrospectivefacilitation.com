## Summary

Diana co-authored "Agile Retrospectives - Making good teams great". Have you ever wondered why you'd need a 5 steps framework? What's wrong in just adding items to 3 columns and picking action items? Read on or listen to the episode.

## Here are a few highlights from David:

If I had to define agile in two words I'd use: continuous improvement.

Agile rests on two pillars: product improvement and process improvement. Everyone understand product improvement, but we often forget how we work together--process improvement--is equally important. A team that has  been togeter for 1 week or 1 month should be less efficient or productive then a team together for much longer. This assumption rest on the assumption that we learn together. The demo is the meeting that catalized product improvement and feedback to me the retrospective is the meeting tha catalized the process improvement part.

The goal of a retrospective is learning. Focus on--hopefully--one area and learn collectively--instead of on your own--so the team can go forward in the next iteration and improve. Without a retrospective we can learn on our own--or watercooler conversation between two individuals--but if we're trying to learn as a team we need to be together in the same room... phisicaly or virtually.

If you ask an agile purist he'd probably say there is no such thing as a remote team in agile. But we live in a geographically displaced world. Most software is built in a distributed fashion. People across continents or perhaps in the same building across different floors. You probably send instant messages.

**In my mind if you have just one person on your team that is remote then you have a remote team.** Suppose you have a 10 person team, 9 sitting in a meeting room and one calling in. Imagine you're that person calling in. Do you have an equal play field? Or to voice your ideas? Understand the conversation? Probably not.

**Once one person is remote we need to act as a remote team.** In regards to retrospectives, you have lots of colocated facilitation techniques but if you have one person remote I don't think you can use the same techniques. Unless everyone can participate in the meeting it's an unfair situation.

When a single person is remote a buddy--in the room--can be assigned. The buddy's job is not just to participate themself but to bubble up the other person's ideas/feelings/input and make sure they keep involved.

There are other ways to encouraging more equal engagement when you have a remote team.

One thing I suggest is if one make everybody remote. So if one is dialing in to the meeting make everyone dial in. This might work or not but experimenting with it is a way to encourage engagement and empathy for the people that will always have to dial in.

There is baseline and baseline per team basis. If video is an option and people are willing to go on video that's obviously better then voice. If people don't have video and have voice that's obviously better then text for most teams. But that's something that you can discover culturally as you learn together.

There is always some individuals that just prefer just audio. To me this is foreign, but there are some legitimate reason for it. Some are embarrassed about their home tidiness, others have poor bandwidth/rural so can't have video on. 

You need a communication mechanism but what that is should be up to the team.

I worked for a large bank and we had people spread around the US and Asia and Europe. That's where I realized how challenging remote retrospectives are.

The offshore team did not have bandwidth for video so it was just audio. It was a round-robin activity to brainstorm ideas. It was naive of me to expect this activity to keep them engaged. There was complete silence from the phone. Finally I said here are 10 ideas, let's see the complexity. And it was fascinated what happened. People in the room reflected and voted the complexity. The remote people went silent and after 5 minutes "we estimate it to be a five". This was a poor facilitation on my side and that event made it click that there was work to do.

Using a web form to submit ideas is a good first step. If you follow the 5 steps format you need a bit more structure so I decided to quit my job and build Retrium.com

When the team is remote you need to be more intentional about un-intentional conversations. When colocated you end up having watercooler conversations or other type of face to face conversations. When you work remotely you need to have at least a joking instant message chanel--like a virtual watercooler area. That's not enough in my opinion. You need more then asyncronous conversation, what I suggest is to
