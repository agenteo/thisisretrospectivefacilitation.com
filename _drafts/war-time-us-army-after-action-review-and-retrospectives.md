This is the second of a series of special episodes where I interview former military war veterans--now working in tech related industries--to reflect on their war time after action review experiences and similarities with agile retrospectives.

In this episode Jon Schneider a fellow Pivot working on the Java Spring team tells us about action items generated during after action review (AAR) in a war zone. He tells us how tactical cycles constantly changes and how the teams collaborated and used ingenuity to adapt and circumvent situations--only apparently--outside their control.
